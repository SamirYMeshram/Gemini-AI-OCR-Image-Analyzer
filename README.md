## ‚öôÔ∏è **Installation and Setup**
Follow the instructions below to get **Gemini AI Image Analyzer** up and running on your local machine.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
Clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Gemini-AI-Image-Analyzer.git
cd Gemini-AI-Image-Analyzer
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
Creating a virtual environment ensures that dependencies are isolated from your system Python. Run the following commands:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/MacOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
Install the required libraries from `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Application
Once the dependencies are installed, run the application:
```bash
python main.py
```
Upon successful execution, the application window will open, and you‚Äôll be able to start processing images.

## üìö **How to Use the Application**
The **Gemini AI Image Analyzer** is designed to be simple and intuitive. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide to using the application:

1. **Launch the Application**: Run `main.py` to open the Gemini AI Image Analyzer GUI.
2. **Upload an Image**: Click the **Choose New Image** button to upload an image file from your computer. 
3. **Extract Text**: The application will automatically extract text from the image using **Gemini AI**. This will be displayed in the results window.
4. **Translate Text (Optional)**: If desired, select a target language and click **Translate Text** to translate the extracted text into the selected language.
5. **Convert Text to Speech**: Click the **Speak Result** button to listen to the extracted or translated text. The speech will be generated in real-time using **pyttsx3**.
6. **Save Results**: You can save the extracted or translated text as a `.txt` file using the **Save Results** button for future reference.

## üìã **Algorithm**
The following is a step-by-step breakdown of how the application functions:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Upload Image**
   - The user selects an image file via the file dialog. 
   - The application captures the file path and begins processing the image asynchronously.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Text Extraction**
   - **Step 1**: The system first tries to extract text from the image using **Gemini AI**.
   - **Step 2**: If text extraction fails, the application uses **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** for text extraction.
   - **Step 3**: The extracted text is displayed in the results textbox.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Translation (Optional)**
   - **Step 4**: The user can choose a target language from a list of over 50 languages.
   - **Step 5**: The system translates the extracted text using the **Google Translate API**.
   - **Step 6**: The translated text is displayed in the results textbox.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Text-to-Speech**
   - **Step 7**: The application uses **pyttsx3** to convert the extracted or translated text into speech.
   - **Step 8**: The speech is played in real-time, and the user can pause, resume, or stop the playback.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Save Results**
   - **Step 9**: The user can save the extracted or translated text as a `.txt` file using the **Save Results** button.

- **tkinter**: For building the GUI.
- **threading**: To enable non-blocking operations.

To install all dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üìã **Troubleshooting**
- **Issue**: Image upload results in error.  
  **Solution**: Ensure the image is in a supported format (e.g., PNG, JPEG, or TIFF). If using OCR, ensure the image is clear and contains legible text.

- **Issue**: Text-to-Speech does not work.  
  **Solution**: Ensure **pyttsx3** is properly installed. Check that your system audio is working.
